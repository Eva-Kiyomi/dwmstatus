# Dependencies
- Fonts for Icons (Emoji)

You will need a Nerd Font to display icons. I use JetBrains Mono Nerd Font.
⚠️ It seems that in Mono fonts, the emoji appear at a proper size, while in other variants they can look tiny. Keep this in mind.

# Installation
```
sudo make clean install
```

# Starting
Add it to autostart:
```
dwmstatus &
```

# Configuring
Actual config is:  
```dwmstatus.c```
You may need to adjust at least the paths in the ```CONFIGURATION``` section, as they vary depending on your device.
This is only necessary if something doesn’t display correctly.
